# SolvingTravellingSalesmanProblemwithGeneticAlgorithm
â€‹Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an optimization problem that aims navigating given a list of city in the shortest possible route and visits each city exactly once. When number of cities increases, solution of TSP with mathematical methods becomes almost impossible. Therefore it is better to use heuristic methods to solve the problem.
